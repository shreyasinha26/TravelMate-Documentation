# My Trip to Bhutan
Bhutan, officially the Kingdom of Bhutan, is a landlocked country in South Asia, situated in the Eastern Himalayas between China in the north and India in the south, with the Indian state of Sikkim separating it from neighbouring Nepal. 
Thimphu is a city full of history, culture, and adventure. I had the chance to explore this beautiful city and experience its vibrant atmosphere.

### Things to know before visiting Bhutan: 

- **Only two airlines fly to Bhutan**: Bhutan is served by two national airlines: Drukair and Bhutan Airlines. Because of the challenging landing conditions at Paro International Airport, surrounded by peaks as high as 5500m (18,000ft), only a select few pilots are authorized to fly there.

- **Bhutan is exceptionally safe**: Bhutan maintains a low crime rate, with violent crime being scarce. As a single woman, I never felt unsafe on any of my trips to Bhutan. 

- **Bhutanese food is spicy and delicious**: For decades, Bhutanese cuisine suffered in reputation because travelers were mostly exposed to mediocre buffets at their three-star hotels, featuring Indian, Chinese and continental dishes tailored precisely to their palates.
