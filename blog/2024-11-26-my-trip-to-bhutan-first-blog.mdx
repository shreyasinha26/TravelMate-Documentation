   # Welcome to Bhutan Adventure

   Here's an exciting blog post about my first trip to Bhutan.

   ## Hiking Tiger's Nest

   One of the highlights of my trip was hiking to the famous Tigerâ€™s Nest Monastery in Bhutan. It was an unforgettable experience!

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function HikingMessage() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h3>Hiking to Tiger's Nest</h3>
         <p>It's a beautiful, breathtaking hike!</p>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default HikingMessage;
